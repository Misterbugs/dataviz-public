Doing so allows the adversary illegitimate access<br>to the target system, without possessing the requisite credentials. Reflection<br>attacks are of great concern to authentication protocols that rely on a<br>challenge-handshake or similar mechanism. An adversary can impersonate a<br>legitimate user and can gain illegitimate access to the system by successfully<br>mounting a reflection attack during authentication.",
