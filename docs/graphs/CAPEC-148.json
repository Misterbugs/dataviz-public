      "Description": "<b>CAPEC-218: Spoofing of UDDI/ebXML Messages</b><br>An attacker spoofs a UDDI, ebXML, or similar message in order to impersonate a<br>service provider in an e-business transaction. UDDI, ebXML, and similar<br>standards are used to identify businesses in e-business transactions. Among<br>other things, they identify a particular participant, WSDL information for SOAP<br>transactions, and supported communication protocols, including security<br>protocols. By spoofing one of these messages an attacker could impersonate a<br>legitimate business in a transaction or could manipulate the protocols used<br>between a client and business. This could result in disclosure of sensitive<br>information, loss of message integrity, or even financial fraud.",

Components that have been<br>unintentionally exported and made public are subject to this type of an attack.<br>If the component trusts the intent's action without verififcation, then the<br>target application performs the functionality at the adversary's request,<br>helping the adversary achieve the desired negative technical impact.",

      "Description": "<b>CAPEC-145: Checksum Spoofing</b><br>An adversary spoofs a checksum message for the purpose of making a payload<br>appear to have a valid corresponding checksum. Checksums are used to verify<br>message integrity. They consist of some value based on the value of the message<br>they are protecting. Hash codes are a common checksum mechanism. Both the sender<br>and recipient are able to compute the checksum based on the contents of the<br>message. If the message contents change between the sender and recipient, the<br>sender and recipient will compute different checksum values. Since the sender's<br>checksum value is transmitted with the message, the recipient would know that a<br>modification occurred. In checksum spoofing an adversary modifies the message<br>body and then modifies the corresponding checksum so that the recipient's<br>checksum calculation will match the checksum (created by the adversary) in the<br>message. This would prevent the recipient from realizing that a change occurred.",

      "Description": "<b>CAPEC-148: Content Spoofing</b><br>An adversary modifies content to make it contain something other than what the<br>original content producer intended while keeping the apparent source of the<br>content unchanged. The term content spoofing is most often used to describe<br>modification of web pages hosted by a target to display the adversary's content<br>instead of the owner's content. However, any content can be spoofed, including<br>the content of email messages, file transfers, or the content of other network<br>communication protocols. Content can be modified at the source (e.g. modifying<br>the source file for a web page) or in transit (e.g. intercepting and modifying a<br>message between the sender and recipient). Usually, the adversary will attempt<br>to hide the fact that the content has been modified, but in some cases, such as<br>with web site defacement, this is not necessary. Content Spoofing can lead to<br>malware exposure, financial fraud (if the content governs financial<br>transactions), privacy violations, and other unwanted outcomes.",
