      "Description": "<b>CAPEC-124: Shared Resource Manipulation</b><br>An adversary exploits a resource shared between multiple applications, an<br>application pool or hardware pin multiplexing to affect behavior. Resources may<br>be shared between multiple applications or between multiple threads of a single<br>application. Resource sharing is usually accomplished through mutual access to a<br>single memory location or multiplexed hardware pins. If an adversary can<br>manipulate this shared resource (usually by co-opting one of the applications or<br>threads) the other applications or threads using the shared resource will often<br>continue to trust the validity of the compromised shared resource and use it in<br>their calculations. This can result in invalid trust assumptions, corruption of<br>additional data through the normal operations of the other users of the shared<br>resource, or even cause a crash or compromise of the sharing applications.",
