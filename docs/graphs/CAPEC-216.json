This attack allows the<br>adversary to gain access to potentially privileged information, and to possibly<br>perpetrate other attacks through the distribution means by impersonation. If the<br>channel/message being manipulated is an input rather than output mechanism for<br>the system, (such as a command bus), this style of attack could be used to<br>change the adversary's identifier to more a privileged one.",
