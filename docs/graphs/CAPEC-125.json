These attacks take advantage of the<br>asymmetric relationship between the processing power used by the client and the<br>processing power used by the server to create a secure connection. In this<br>manner the attacker can make a large number of HTTPS requests on a low<br>provisioned machine to tie up a disproportionately large number of resources on<br>the server.

The goal of this attack is<br>to use a relatively few resources to create a large amount of traffic against a<br>target server. To execute this attack, an adversary send a request to a 3rd<br>party service, spoofing the source address to be that of the target server. The<br>larger response that is generated by the 3rd party service is then sent to the<br>target server. By sending a large number of initial requests, the adversary can<br>generate a tremendous amount of traffic directed at the target. The greater the<br>discrepancy in size between the initial request and the final payload delivered<br>to the target increased the effectiveness of this attack.",
