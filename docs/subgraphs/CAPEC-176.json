Many<br>applications utilize registries to store configuration and service information.<br>As such, modification of registry information can affect individual services<br>(affecting billing, authorization, or even allowing for identity spoofing) or<br>the overall configuration of a targeted application. For example, both Java RMI<br>and SOAP use registries to track available services. Changing registry values is<br>sometimes a preliminary step towards completing another attack pattern, but<br>given the long term usage of many registry values, manipulation of registry<br>information could be its own end.",
