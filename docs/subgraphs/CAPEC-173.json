For example, a user might be led to believe that clicking a button will<br>submit a query, but in fact it downloads software. Adversaries may perform this<br>attack through social means, such as by simply convincing a victim to perform<br>the action or relying on a user's natural inclination to do so, or through<br>technical means, such as a clickjacking attack where a user sees one interface<br>but is actually interacting with a second, invisible, interface.",

The first is to leverage<br>transparent properties that allow taps on the screen to pass through the visible<br>application to an application running in the background. The second is to<br>strategically place a small object (e.g., a button or text field) on top of the<br>visible screen and make it appear to be a part of the underlying application. In<br>both cases, the user is convinced to tap on the screen but does not realize the<br>application that they are interacting with.",
