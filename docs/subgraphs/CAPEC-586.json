      "Description": "<b>CAPEC-586: Object Injection</b><br>An adversary attempts to exploit an application by injecting additional,<br>malicious content during its processing of serialized objects. Developers<br>leverage serialization in order to convert data or state into a static, binary<br>format for saving to disk or transferring over a network. These objects are then<br>deserialized when needed to recover the data/state. By injecting a malformed<br>object into a vulnerable application, an adversary can potentially compromise<br>the application by manipulating the deserialization process. This can result in<br>a number of unwanted outcomes, including remote code execution.",
