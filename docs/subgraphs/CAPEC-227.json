The adversary's primary goal is not to crash or flood<br>the target, which would alert defenders; rather it is to repeatedly perform<br>actions or abuse algorithmic flaws such that a given resource is tied up and not<br>available to a legitimate user. By carefully crafting a requests that keep the<br>resource engaged through what is seemingly benign requests, legitimate users are<br>limited or completely denied access to the resource.",

This<br>denial of service attack requires substantially fewer packets to be sent which<br>makes DoS harder to detect. This is an equivalent of SYN flood in HTTP. The idea<br>is to keep the HTTP session alive indefinitely and then repeat that hundreds of<br>times. This attack targets resource depletion weaknesses in web server software.<br>The web server will wait to attacker's responses on the initiated HTTP sessions<br>while the connection threads are being exhausted.",
