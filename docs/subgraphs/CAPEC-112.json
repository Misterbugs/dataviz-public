The adversary<br>tries a particular password for each user account, before moving onto the next<br>password in the list. This approach assists the adversary in remaining<br>undetected by avoiding rapid or frequent account lockouts. The adversary may<br>then reattempt the process with additional passwords, once enough time has<br>passed to prevent inducing a lockout.",
