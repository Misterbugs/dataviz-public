For<br>example, eShoplifting is a data manipulation attack against an on-line merchant<br>during a purchasing transaction. The manipulation of price, discount or quantity<br>fields in the transaction message allows the adversary to acquire items at a<br>lower cost than the merchant intended. The adversary performs a normal<br>purchasing transaction but edits hidden fields within the HTML form response<br>that store price or other information to give themselves a better deal. The<br>merchant then uses the modified pricing information in calculating the cost of<br>the selected items.",
